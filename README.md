###Requirements
---------------
* [Plex Media Server][pms] (v0.9.8+) and a [PlexPass][pp] membership `These are both free.`
* The weather sidebar requires a [forecast.io API key][fcAPI] 
```The forecast.io API is free for the first 1000 API calls per day. Every API call after that costs $1 per 10,000 (that is, 0.01Â¢). I average 300-400 calls per day and have only ever gone over 1000 when debugging and have never needed to provide billing info.```
* Web server that supports php (apache, nginx, XAMPP, WampServer, EasyPHP, lighttpd, etc)
* PHP 5.4

**Note:** While this project is written with OS X in mind, it can very easily be adapted to run on linux or windows
by rewriting the functions that don't work on those platforms.
